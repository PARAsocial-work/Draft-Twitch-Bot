# Draft-Twitch-Bot

A first draft for a Twitch Bot with anon whisper functionality

Drafted by Para of https://twitch.tv/PARAsocial_work


The goal of this project is having a twitch bot which listens to chat, as well as listening to whispers - and importantly enables quasi-anonymous message functionality. 


This code is excluding the aesthetic side of things - it's just all about getting feedback on how I'm making it function.

Console messages now are placeholders for what will go to a lil prettyified browser source window for me to read during stream.

My plan is to hold chat messages on a top 'chat' box, and anon whispers in a bottom 'anons' box. 

But that's all aesthetics. 


The audience for this draft repository is explicitly members of my audience who've offered to look over the code. 

While being kind around messy/ugly code is appreciated since I'm very much an amateur, please don't be afraid to say if you've got concerns about something. 

Thanks for reading and fingers crossed that this is looking ok!
